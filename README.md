My name is Samra Vatan Parast.

A Microsoft certified data analyst associate with a background in finance and business.

I have proven experience working in a fast-paced and demanding environment and handling sensetive and confidential data. 

Possess a Bachelor of Business Economics from the University of Tabriz, Iran, and a Certificate in Data Analytics Bootcamp from Monash University, Australia.

I love mining hidden gems located within large sets of structured, semi-structured, and raw data and drawing insightful visualisations to help senior managers make informed business decisions.
